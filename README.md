### :clipboard: Summary
The goal of this project is to build a one-wheeled robot from scratch. This includes mechanical design of the robot, component selection, electrical design, control system design and embedded programming. The MCU at the hearth of the robot is a Teensy 4.0, packing enough computational power to experiment with optimisation based control strategies. I started this project with two goals in mind: rehearsing a number of important aspects of control theory and the Arduino C/C++ languages and generally improving my embedded programming skills. 

### :construction: Progress
- [x] Model derivation using Euler-Lagrange equations
- [x] 3D design of robot in Solidworks
- [x] Component selection
- [x] LQR control system design
- [ ] Circuit design
- [ ] Coding
- [ ] 3D printing parts and assembly
- [ ] Countless hours of debugging untill this thing will work

### :computer: Simulation results
