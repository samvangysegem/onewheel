## Personal Notes

### Flywheel Design
3D printed wheel lacks the weight to fulfill the role of a flywheel. Therefore, a number of bolts are added at a large outside diameter to increase the total moment of inertia.

According to the site mentioned above, the total weight of 100 M8 bolts is approximately 1.11kg, resulting in a weight of 11.1g x 12 at a radius of 40mm (without nuts).

Outside diameter: 95mm
Inside diameter: 7mm
Diameter of bols: 80mm
Pitch diameter fastening nuts: 19.06mm
Diameter fastening nuts: 3.4mm
